DESCRIPTION

You are a DevOps engineer at XYZ Ltd. Your company is working on a Java application and wants to automate WAR file artifact deployment so that they donâ€™t have to perform WAR deployment on Tomcat/Jetty web containers.

2. Install Ansible plugins in Jenkins CI server
3. Prepare Ansible playbook to run Maven build on Jenkins CI server
4. Prepare Ansible playbook to execute deployment steps on the remote web container with restart of the web container post deployment
